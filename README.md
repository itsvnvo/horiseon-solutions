## Horiseon refactoring the html and css

## General

The html code were all out of order and some of the following functions did not work. The html semantics and elements were out of order for example h2 was after h3. The css style sheet as well was out of order and all over the place.

Refactored all the code by placing them in order, added comments so it is easier to navigate through the code, made sure the file pathing is correct. The website should be working as designed now.
